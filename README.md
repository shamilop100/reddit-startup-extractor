# reddit-startup-extractor
A Python-based pipeline that scrapes startup-related comments from Reddit, uses a local LLM (via Ollama) to extract structured information such as startup name, location, website, and description, and stores the results in an SQLite database. Ideal for analyzing early-stage startups, market research, or building datasets for AI applications.
